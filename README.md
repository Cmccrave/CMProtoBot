# McRave - A Broodwar Bot
For any questions, email christianmccrave@gmail.com , McRave was started January 3rd 2017, latest readme update December 6th 2017 and is developed in C++ using Visual Studio Express 2013, BWAPI 4.1.2 and BWEM 1.4.1.

**Thanks to:**
- Nathan Roth (Antiga/Iruian) for expert analysis on my replays and advice on build orders.
- Dan Gant (PurpleWave) for help with learning C++, coding structure and general Broodwar gameplay.

**New Features:**
- Corsair attack and move forward (probably works for most air units)
- Improved a few early game strategies and build orders
