# McRave - A Broodwar Bot
## For any questions, email christianmccrave@gmail.com
## Bot started January 3rd 2017, latest readme update November 23rd 2017.

## Thanks to:
- Nathan Roth (Antiga/Iruian) for expert analysis on my replays and advice on build orders.
- Dan Gant (PurpleWave) for help with learning C++, coding structure and general Broodwar gameplay.

A Broodwar AI Developed in C++ using Visual Studio Express 2013, BWAPI and BWEM.

**New Features:**
- Corsair attack and move forward (probably works for most air units)
- Improved a few early game strategies and build orders
